# Ideology_analysis
**Project: Ideological Analysis through Quote Mining**
*Project Description:*
Explored the manifestation of thinking and ideology through an analysis of quotes from various authors. Drawing inspiration from social learning theory, the project aimed to understand how exposure to different ideologies influences belief adoption and behavior. Collected quotes from diverse authors to uncover common themes, beliefs, and values, providing insights into larger cultural and societal trends. Employed machine learning models and advanced deep learning models, including Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and BERT, for comprehensive dataset training.
